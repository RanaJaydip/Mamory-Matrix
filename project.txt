Creating the basic HTML page structure
In this step, we will create the basic structure of our Memory Matrix game using HTML. Also known as HyperText Markup Language, this is the backbone of any web page. It provides the structure and content of the page by using various elements and tags.

What is HTML?
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to create the structure of web pages. HTML consists of a series of elements that tell the browser how to display content. These elements are represented by tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., <tag>).

Let's get started!
Weâ€™ve already opened your index.html file in the editor on the right-hand side of your screen.

Why do we name the first HTML file index.html?
We name the file index.html because it is the default file that web servers look for when loading a website. When you navigate to a website, the server automatically looks for a file named index.html in the root directory to display as the homepage.

Add the code from the block below to your index.html file which will serve as the foundation for our Memory Matrix game. To do this, select the "Copy" button and paste it in the editor on the right:
html

  Copy
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Memory Matrix: Icons of Computing</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/styles.css">
        
    </head>
    <body>


    </body>
</html>
By setting up this basic HTML structure, we have laid the groundwork for our Memory Matrix game. At this time, the browser would display a white screen since we do not have any content to display. In the next step, we will add some content to our page.
